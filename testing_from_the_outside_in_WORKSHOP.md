# Testing From The Outside In (Workshop)

You know that TDD means Test Driven Development, right? What if I told you that was wrong? TDD actually stands for Test Driven DESIGN!

This workshop uses tests to design your public API, break down a problem, and create meaningful units of code. We will use tests to write code from the outside in!

## Description

This workshop starts with a slide deck that describes a classical approach to Test Driven Devlopment, discussing the shortcommings of this approach. Then it describes the fundamentals of Test Driven Design when testing from the outside in. After the slides there is a guided exercise that walks participants through the process as pairs. This is followed by a take-home exercise that will expand on the ideas presented in the workshop.

The format follows the idea of Global Day of Code Retreat. During a code retreat, participants are given a presentation on the concept of treating software development as a craft. This means taking time to focus on honing our abilities in the craft outside of production coding. Code retreat is a chance to dogmattically explore aspects of software development that you wouldn't be able to in day-to-day production coding.

Participants will be presented a new mental model. They will then have a chance to explore that idea with a guide. Finally, they will be given a challenge to help solidify the idea with an exercise to complete later.

## Notes

I work for a consulting company, Test Double, who has been striving to help improve the way teams we work with write code. The most impactful thing that we do is help teams understand better testing strategies. We've invested a lot in promoting the idea of outside in development. I've coached many people on adopting this technique to produce code that is easier to maintain, change, and trust. I've helped organize code retreats, given talks on testing in this way, and organized workshops for meetups that focus on testing. Here are the materials from the most recent workshop I gave on the topic: https://github.com/samjonester/tdd-workshop
