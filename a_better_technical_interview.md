# A Better Technical Interview

# Abstract
**Let's make a valuable interview** by setting better expectations and creating better evaluation techniques.

**Let's make an honest interview** by asking instead of assuming, and treating candidates like they'll be treated on the team.

**Let's make a collective interview** by encouraging dialog and testing a candidate's to teach, learn, and work with teammates.

**Let's make a nice interview** by ensuring the process is valuable to the candidate even if they're not yet ready to join the team.

# Details
Before the interview, we'll define transparent expectations. Then we'll explore ways to make the interview a safe place for dialog, and we'll do our best to eliminate biases. While interviewing, we can ensure that the structure of our interview represents the way the team actually works. After the interview, a candidate should have learned something valuable even if they aren't yet ready to join the team.

Some of the example techniques that will be discussed are:
- Using a take home and pair exercises more effectively by focusing on collaboration and code design, rather than completing algorithms in unrealistic environments while onlookers silently judge.
- Defining and disclosing better expectations for a candidate.
- Defining values to ensure consistent evaluations.
- Humanizing yourself and complimenting / encouraging candidates like they were teammates.
- Reframing the idea a "no" into a "not yet" to create a more valuable experience for all candidates.
- Reframing the idea of a "cultural fit" into "cultural addition" to eliminate biasing towards a monoculture.
- Discussing common practices that cause biases during an interview.
- Creating an advocate for a candidate to smooth the process.

# Pitch
A Better Technical Interview is a response to (rightfully) grumpy tweets about how technical interviews are ineffective.

Candidates shouldn't be afraid that shouldn't be afraid that a technical interview won't reflect their true abilities. They should feel that an interview valuable even if the decision is "Not Yet".

My team has been continuously improving our interview process for multiple years, and this talk shares our learning. A Better Technical Interview presents an alternative to buzzword driven interviews and unrealistic coding exercises that are too often used to evaluate a candidate. The most valuable things a candidate can bring to a team aren't rote programming skills, and A Better Technical Interview provides techniques to properly evaluate what's truly important.
