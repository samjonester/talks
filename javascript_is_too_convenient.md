# Title

JavaScript Is Too Convenient

# Abstract

Which conveniences do we take advantage of everyday? Which are taking advantage of us?

Objects and functions sure are convenient, so convenient that we do many shortsighted things just because they're easy.

In-line objects and anonymous functions create a poor signal to noise ratio, making it hard to understand your code.

Learn ways to give confusing things names, focus on what's important, and write nicer code.

# Description

Conveniences we love in JavaScript are discouraging us from writing concise, descriptive code.

In-line objects and anonymous functions deprive us of important domain names. They add noise that distracts from the purpose of a function. This is even true in tests. Tests should help us feel the code we write, but instead they're confusing us with complex data and unrelated setup.

These conveniences encourage us to create functions that do too much. They help us write code that lacks focus and intent.

"JavaScript is too Convenient" will encourage you to give complex things names, find the purpose of each unit of code, and focus on things that promote understanding.

# Notes

Think back to the last time you had to change code. Remember the emotions it made you feel. We want to write code that encourages confidence when it's changed and read. We do this by leaving signposts in the form of domain names. We do this by removing noise that distracts from the purpose of our code.

The goal of writing understandable, changeable code is at odds with our favorite conveniences in JavaScript. This talk highlights that fact by first looking at how we wind up in a bad situation, them teaching the audience how to fix it.
